<h2>Instructions to Run Pokémon Dawn</h2>
<p>Due to GitHub size limitations we were unable to place the jar file in the repository so we hosted it on another website where you can download and run PokemonDawn</p>

<h2>Basic Gameplay</h2>
<p>Arrow keys allow you to move around the map.
Sometimes you will need a mouse to click buttons such as when you go into the PokeShop. Click O for options, spacebar to talk to NPCs, and enter to choose an option when battling other Pokemon.</p>
<p>If all of your Pokemon faint then you respawn back in your house, so make sure to visit the PokeCentre often to heal up.</p>
<p>There are many hidden rooms, legendary pokemon, and surprises in the game so take your time, have fun, and explore the map!</p>
