Welcome to the world of Pokemon!
My name is Pine.
But everyone calls me the Professor.
This is what we call a "Pokemon".
This world is widely inhabited Pokemon.
We humans live amongside Pokemon.
But despite our closeness,
we don't know everything about Pokemon.
There are many secrets surrounding Pokemon.
My mission is to unravel Pokemon mysteries.
That's what I do.
What's your name by the way?
who's moving to my
hometown of Oakville.
Your very own adventure is about to unfold.
Come see me in my Pokemon Lab later.
